# Welcome! 
My name is Zoheir Shaikh. 
I am a Master’s student in Cybersecurity at the University of Houston with hands-on experience in security testing and automation, alert triage, and threat research.  
My interests span in **offensive security**, particularly in cloud security, and **application security**, with a focus on learning how real-world security teams operate.

Feel free to explore my Portfolio Website via **Commands** or Navigation.
